# Vendors need some way to know if an item is really good and worth breaking their usual
# stinginess to purchase. To decide this, the full sales price is divided by the base

# magic attributes). This ratio must be higher then the number in this configuration

# Cash on hand is the money that vendors use to pay for the items that the players sell them.
# Players cannot sell things to vendors when the vendor runs out of funds.
# The "Target" cash-on-hand numbers indicate that lower and upper bound on what a vendor
# would have if it were left alone for many days. Each vendor gets a unique target within
# that range, and each vendor's target is randomized pseudo-daily, as with cashflow (below).
#
# This calculation will not occur during long periods of dormancy; once a vendor
# reaches equilibrium (plus 3 days of fluctuations; e.g. their cash-on-hand is
# between the target bounds 3 days in a row), they will no longer be
# simulated (until a player buys or sells from them). To avoid statistical bias
# created by this timing and the cash inflow/outflow parameters, reaching this
# dormancy limit will cause the vendor's cash-on-hand to be once again randomized
# to some number within this target-cash-on-hand range.

# The amount of money (in gold coins) that vendors "make" or "lose" every day,

# The maximum amount of gold a vendor can have on hand.
# This number should be larger than the other gold-on-hand metrics,
# and can only be reached if players buy things from the vendor.

# Each vendor has a unique final maximum for gold-on-hand, which
# is the result of a dice-roll. It will be chosen to be somewhere
# in the interval [low,high).
MaxCashOnHandLow=40000
MaxCashOnHandHigh=60000

# These numbers determine how long a vendor's max-cash-on-hand number
# (chosen by the above MaxCashOnHand(Low|High) parameters) will remain
# the same. When a vendor's max-cash-on-hand value changes and becomes
# less than what they have on hand, they can keep the change: their
# wallet will deplete anyways, at least until it reachs their
# target-cash-on-hand.
